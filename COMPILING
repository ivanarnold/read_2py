Compilation information for ADAS subroutines

This documentation refers to official collection of files which have been
extracted from ADAS. It is the recommended that, for ADAS members, instead of
using these subroutines you call the pre-compiled ADAS libraries. Manual
compilation is only recommended when integration with non-standard compilers or
operating systems (especially parallel architectures) is required.

As such, makefiles and compilation files are not supplied for subroutine
collections since the expectation is that they will be integrated into a larger
program. A simple test.sh script is included which shows simple compilation
and use of the subroutine.

The fortran routines have been tested with most UNIX versions of g77, gfortran,
ifort (only version 9), pgf77, pgf90, and the Sun Fortran compiler.

They have been minimally testing against the Absoft and NAG compilers with no
real testing on other compilers. The Fortran is relatively clean so it is
expected that most Fortran compilers should cope.
